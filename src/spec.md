# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Use the two uploaded images as fixed, full-viewport background images on the Landing and Gratitude pages without breaking existing UI behavior or navigation.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Landing page to apply `/assets/3a6059bf59d32f6f27e0496b5424853a.jpg` as a full-page background (cover/center), fixed behind all existing content, preserving Yes/No layout and the No button’s evasive interactions.
- Update the Gratitude page to apply `/assets/2fe29e3f61a6e53093c503c181238cdc.jpg` as a full-page background (cover/center) behind existing content, maintaining readability and layout.

**User-visible outcome:** The Landing and Gratitude pages display the uploaded photos as full-screen backgrounds while all current UI remains usable and the Landing → Gratitude flow continues to work.
