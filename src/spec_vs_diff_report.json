  "summary": "REQ-2 is implemented via a new Next button on ReplyPage and state-based navigation in App to a new FarewellPage. REQ-1 is mostly implemented (click-to-edit, focus, saving via useReplyPersistence.save, disabled/loading while saving, exit edit mode), but the Save button is only rendered while editing rather than being always present at the bottom of the reply box. REQ-3 is mostly implemented (new FarewellPage, exact-looking message, kissing emoji overlay hidden after 5 seconds), but the rendered message may not be exactly identical due to the missing leading space shown in the requirement’s quoted text. Several unrequested visual/theme changes and footer branding were also added.",
  "missing_requirements": [

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "A Save button is rendered at the bottom/end of the reply box container (visually attached to the reply box section).",
      "reason": "In the diff, the Save button is conditionally rendered only when `isEditing` is true; the requirement/AC indicates the Save button should be rendered at the bottom/end of the reply box (not only during edit mode).",

      "reason": "The requirement shows the message string starting with a leading space after the opening quote (\" Bye ...\"), but the FarewellPage renders it without that leading space (\"Bye ...\"). This may violate the 'exactly as given' constraint.",
